# Income_Urban_VS_Rural-Analysis
This project analyzes household income and population distributions across urban and rural counties in the United States. The dataset contains demographic and economic indicators, enabling a comparative study of urban and rural regions to identify disparities, trends, and key insights.

üìä Dataset Description
The dataset includes information on:

County and State names
FIPS Codes (Federal Information Processing Standards) for identification
Total Population per county
Median Household Income for economic insights
Urban-Rural Classification to distinguish between urban and rural counties

üîç Key Analysis & Visualizations
Income Comparison: Median household income distribution across urban and rural areas
Population Trends: Total population variations by region
State & County-Level Insights: Most populous states/counties and their classification
Urban vs. Rural Differences: Statistical comparisons, including visualizations (box plots, violin plots, bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps)
Geospatial Analysis: Urban-rural distribution across the U.S. using treemaps and sunburst charts

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and visualization

üìà Key Findings
Urban areas generally have higher median incomes than rural regions.
Population distribution shows urban areas as more densely populated.
Certain states, such as Texas and Georgia, have a significant number of counties.
FIPS code distributions reveal regional patterns in urban-rural classification.
